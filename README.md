# Obsidian Sample Imba Plugin

This is a sample plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).
It supports building plugins using Imba (https://imba.io).

## Benefits

### 1. Quickly prototype your plugin idea with Imba
If you enjoy using Obsidian and want to create plugins for it, 
this template gives you a chance to use Imba as your preferred language.

Simply clone it, install the dependencies and start creating. 

Take a look at the "Getting started" section for detailed guidance.

### 2. Live-test your plugin and iterate with a zen feedback loop
Powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) which delegates to [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for fast compilation and efficient bundling.

This starter comes with the usual "npm run dev" to watch for changes in your `.imba` files and rebuild your plugin.

See the "Flow state" for guidance on how to setup a seamless integration with Obsidian in order to live test your plugin as you build it.

### 3. Easily build an optimized version of your plugin to publish
